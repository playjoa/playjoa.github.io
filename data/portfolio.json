    "title": "About Me",
    "content": "I'm a Senior Game Engineer with +7 years in the game industry. My speciality is in Unity Engine (2D, 3D & AR), but I'm also experienced in Unreal Engine 5. My work spans from mobile games (Android & iOS) to larger cross platform multiplayer games (Mobile, Console & PC), with a strong focus on gameplay mechanics, scalable architecture, UI/UX, analytics, progression and AI systems. Throughout my career I've acquired expertise mainly in C# for Unity, but I'm also able to code in C++ and Blueprints (Unreal). I have solid experience in network APIs, such as Mirror Networking and Photon Network. To ensure player progression I use back-end services such as Firebase, Playfab and Accelbyte. On the AI side, I enjoy developing smarter NPCs and bots using GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning) and Behavior Trees, adding depth and strategy to the gameplay."
